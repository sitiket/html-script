<p> 
    A <i> microprocessor </i> is a computer processor where <br>
    the data processing logic and control is <br>
     included on a single integrated circuit, <br>
    or a small number of integrated circuits. <br>
    The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, <br>
    and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a <br>
    computer's central processing unit. The integrated circuit is capable of <br>
     interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic <br>
      operations. <br>
    The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor"> Microprocessor </a>is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, <br>
      digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it <br>
       according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form)  <br>
       as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic,<br>
     and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system. <br>

    This article is about the electronic device. For experiments in an evacuated pipe, see Free <br>
     For the transport system, see Pneumatic tube. For Blood sampling, see Vacutainer. <br>
Later thermionic vacuum tubes, mostly miniature style, some with top cap connections for higher voltages <br>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube#:~:text=A%20vacuum%20tube%2C%20electron%20tube,potential%20difference%20has%20been%20applied."> vacuum tube </a>, <br>
 electron tube, valve (British usage), or tube (North America),[4] is a device that <br>
 controls electric current flow in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference <br>
  has been applied. <br>
The type known as a thermionic tube or thermionic valve utilizes thermionic emission of electrons <br>
 from a hot cathode for fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current <br>
  rectification. Non-thermionic types such as a vacuum phototube, however, achieve electron emission <br>
   through the photoelectric effect, and are used for such purposes as the detection of light intensities. <br> 
   In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode by the electric field in the tube <br>
Audio power amplifier using tubes, in operation. Red-orange glow is from heated filaments. <br>

 potentials. Not shown are the impedances (resistors or inductors) that would be included in series with <br>
 the C and B voltage sources. <br>
The simplest vacuum tube, the diode (i.e. Fleming valve), invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming, contains only <br> 
a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. Electrons can only flow in one direction through the deviceâ€”from <br>
 the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more control grids within the tube allows the current between the cathode <br>
 and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grids. <br>
These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century. <br>
 They were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, sound recording and reproduction, <br>
 long-distance telephone networks, and analog and early digital computers. Although some applications  <br>
  had used earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter for radio or mechanical computers for  <br>
  computing, it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread <br>
   and practical, and created the discipline of electronics. <br>

<h2 id="es"> Evelution of sensors</h2> 
<p>
    How  <a href="https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/sensors/magnachip-es-design-magazine-sensor-evolution"> sensor technology</a> <br>
    is changing in order to meet growing demand from the handheld device sector. <br>
    Dr Seong-Min Choe, Team Manager of New Market Development, Display Solutions Division, MaganChip <br>
    Semiconductor, discusses in this ES Design magazine article. <br>
    Since the first P-N-P Germanium transistor was invented in 1947, semiconductor laboratories and <br>
    companies have been providing electronics industry with 70+ kinds of semiconductor devices for <br>
    rectifying, amplifying, switching, memory, lighting, actuating, sensing, energy harvesting and <br>
    so on. Diodes and metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors are widely used in mass volume, from <br>
    power management to computing, in applications ranging from consumer to industrial. Meanwhile, <br>
    major sensing devices evolved mainly in specific applications such as control systems, medical <br>
    instruments, and automotive. The semiconductor sensor industry has carved out a specialty <br>
    niche thanks to multi-principal state-of-the-art of device physics, analogue circuitry <br>
    design and production technology that lies outside the traditional fabless-foundry business model. <br>

<h2 id="arm"> ARM </h2>
<p> 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family"> ARM </a>(stylised in lowercase as arm, <br>
    formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and <br>
    originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) <br>
   instruction set architectures for computer processors, configured for various <br>
   Arm Ltd. develops the architectures and licenses them to other companies, who design their <br>
  own products that implement one or more of those architectures, including system on a chip <br>
 (SoC) and system on module (SOM) designs, that incorporate different components such as memory, <br>
 interfaces, and radios. It also designs cores that implement these instruction set architectures <br>
 and licenses these designs to many companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products. <br>
    Due to their low costs, minimal power consumption, and lower heat generation than their competitors, <br>
    ARM processors are desirable for light, portable, battery-powered devices, including smartphones, <br>
    laptops and tablet computers, and other embedded systems. However, ARM processors are also used <br>
    for desktops and servers, including the world's fastest supercomputer (Fugaku) from 2020 to 2022. <br>
    With over 230 billion ARM chips produced, as of 2022, ARM is the most widely used family of <br>
    instruction set architectures (ISA) and the ISAs produced in the largest quantity. <br>
     Currently, the widely used Cortex cores, older "classic" cores, and specialised SecurCore cores <br>
     variants are available for each of these to include or exclude optional capabilities. <br>
    There have been several generations of the ARM design. The original ARM1 used a 32-bit internal <br>
    structure but had a 26-bit address space that limited it to 64 MB of main memory. This limitation <br>
was removed in the ARMv3 series, which has a 32-bit address space, and several additional generations <br>
up to ARMv7 remained 32-bit. Released in 2011, the ARMv8-A architecture added support for a 64-bit <br>
 address space and 64-bit arithmetic with its new 32-bit fixed-length instruction set. <br>
 Arm Ltd. has also released a series of additional instruction sets for different rules; <br>
  the "Thumb" extension adds both 32- and 16-bit instructions for improved code density, while <br>
   Jazelle added instructions for directly handling Java bytecode. More recent changes include <br>
    the addition of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) for improved performance or fault tolerance. <br>
